# recipe rule
- use Config Recipe
- dont use Atomic Recipe (cva)


# Best Practices
- Leverage css variables in the base styles as much as possible. Makes it easier to theme the component with JS
- Don't mix styles by writing complex selectors. Separate concerns and group them in logical variants
- Use the compoundVariants property to create more complex sets of styles
